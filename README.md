# Custom-Kit-Creator
Make custom weapon kits for splatoon 1

GUI to make custom kits, poorly coded by someone who doesn't know c++. Choose the kits then press generate. You will need to use switch toolbox or some other tool to actually insert it into the static.pack (i will add that here later).
<br/>Made using QT Creator 17.0.0 (Community)

If you fork this you cannot change the name of the project such that the word Custom and Creator start with the letter K.
